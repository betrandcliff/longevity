                                            LONGEVITY INTIME TASK C

 I am  implementing task C from the figma design, based on the design for all the pages to be linked very well, all the previous page like that of A and B has to be implemented first.

 Since I started from C, this means the order in which the pages appear on the figma design, won't be the same how it will appear on this app when it's been executed. 

 I have just linked all the pages together so that the output can be seen. but when the whole system is implemented, that is when this app will look like what is on the figma design.

 I buttom sheets
